Bankist App

Bankist is a front-end banking application that provides a mock interface for user authentication, account management, and financial transactions. Built in JavaScript, it demonstrates handling complex UI interactions and asynchronous code.

Techniques and Features
- DOM Manipulation: Extensive use of DOM methods for interactive UI ([MDN DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)).
- Intl.NumberFormat: Formats currency and dates based on locale ([MDN Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat)).
